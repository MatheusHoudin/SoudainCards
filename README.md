# SoudainCards

As a polyglot I always wanted to create something that could potencially help other people to learn languages, and my way of doing it is through the development of Soudain.

Soudain is a modern flashcard app in which is going to help you throughout your learning process and creating connections between you and other learners, allowing content sharing users.

This project uses the following technologies and methodologies:

- Mobile

- API(Backend)

    *Express
